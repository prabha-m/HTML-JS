VARIABLES:
//Variable stores a single data value which can be changed later.

//Variables are usually defined using var Keyword.
   syntax:
   var <variable-name>= <value>;

//JavaScript allows variable to be declared without var keyword.
  Assinging a value while declaring a variable is necessary in this case.
  Variables defined without var keyword becomes global variable.
  Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in the webpage.

//Variables must be initalized before using.

//Multiple variables can be defined in a single line seperated by a comma.
   var course=java, duration=3

//C# or Java has strongly typed variables.
   It means variable must be declared with a particular data type, 
   which tells what type of data the variable will hold.
  
   JavaScript variables are loosely-typed which means it does not require a data type to be declared. 
   You can assign any type of literal values to a variable e.g. string, integer, float, boolean etc..
   Variables in Javascript are loosely typed variables.
